## Problem RapidAlert Solves
Inefficiencies and inabilities of our current system to effectively report, handle and communicate in times  of emergencies 

* No quick and easy way for reporting
* Lack of usage of automated technologies to detect various accidents
* Lack of an automatable endpoint for such emergencies
* Lack of effective communication resources between various rapid response services


## Solution
Quick and easy way for people to report accidents and request emergency services. The platform consists of a websitallows users to report accidents in real-time, including information such as the location, type of accident, and required help such as ambulance, police, and fire force.

We have also done two automated emergency reporting mechanisms :
*  OpenCV based fire detection
* Node-MCU based fire detector using flame sensor


## Key Features

* Real-time updates using Firebase.
* Integration with  Maps.
* User Authentication using Mobile Number
* Clean and simple UI
* Easy to read and write endpoints
* Automated Detection System Integration
